# brave-debloat
Removes unnecessary bloat from Brave Browser.

-------

# What is disabled?

The following items are disabled by appling brave debloat:

* Brave rewards & Wallet
* Brave VPN
* Brave AI/Leo (some people may like Leo, in which case you can reenable it following the [customization guide](https://github.com/MulesGaming/brave-debloat/wiki/Customization))
* Changes Brave's ad-ridden homepage to [search.brave.com](https://search.brave.com) (*Only available on linux*)
* Disables the password manager (I recommend using a third party password manager such as [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) or [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass) that isn't tied to Brave sync or any one browser.)
* Disabled Brave's Tor integration as it is insecure.

# How does it work?

Brave debloat uses [group policies](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039248271-Group-Policy) typically used to manage organisations browsers to force disable fetures. Group policies are the only way to completly hide these fetures from settings and context menus.

# Installation

Windows: https://github.com/mattvisa/brave-debloat/wiki/Installation-instructions#windows
Note: I recommend using Slim Brace if your on windows as it does a similar thing as [brave debloat](https://github.com/ltx0101/SlimBrave) but provides more customization via a gui.

Linux: https://github.com/mattvisa/brave-debloat/wiki/Installation-instructions#linux
